# NotifyX Backend-Frontend Integration PRD

## Project Overview

Integrate the NotifyX frontend application with the backend API to create a fully functional job portal platform. The backend provides 45+ REST API endpoints for authentication, job management, user profiles, payments, subscriptions, and admin functionality.

## Current State

### Frontend Status

- ❌ No real backend integration (all data is mocked)

### Backend Status
- ✅ 45+ API endpoints ready and tested
- ✅ JWT authentication system
- ✅ Complete user management
- ✅ Job management with search/filtering
- ✅ Payment integration (Razorpay)
- ✅ Job matching algorithms
- ✅ Email notification system
- ✅ Admin dashboard APIs

- Handle admin-specific features and permissions

### 8. Error Handling and UX
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add loading states and skeletons
- Create user-friendly error messages
- Handle network errors and timeouts
- Add retry mechanisms for failed requests

### 9. Email Notification Integration
- Connect email notification system
- Add notification preferences
- Implement email templates
- Handle notification queue status
- Add email testing and debugging tools

### 10. Data Validation and Type Safety
- Implement runtime data validation
- Add TypeScript type checking
- Handle API response validation
- Add form validation with backend rules
- Implement data transformation utilities

## Technical Specifications

### API Integration
- Base URL: http://localhost:3000 (development)
- Authentication: JWT Bearer tokens
- Content Type: application/json
- Error Handling: Standardized error responses
- Rate Limiting: Implemented on backend

### Data Flow
1. Frontend makes API request with JWT token
2. Backend validates token and processes request
3. Backend returns structured JSON response
4. Frontend validates response and updates UI
5. Error handling and user feedback

### Security Requirements
- JWT token storage in localStorage
- Automatic token refresh on expiration
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure file upload handling

### Performance Requirements
- API response time < 2 seconds
- Implement request caching where appropriate
- Lazy loading for large datasets
- Optimistic UI updates
- Error retry with exponential backoff

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ All 45+ backend endpoints integrated
- ✅ Complete authentication flow working
- ✅ Job search and application system functional
- ✅ Payment processing working end-to-end
- ✅ Admin dashboard fully functional
- ✅ User profile management complete
- ✅ Job recommendations working
- ✅ Email notifications functional

### Non-Functional Requirements
- ✅ Type-safe integration throughout
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Loading states for all async operations
- ✅ Responsive design maintained
- ✅ Performance optimized
- ✅ Security best practices implemented

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)
- API configuration and base URL management
- TypeScript interfaces matching backend
- JWT authentication system
- API service layer

### Phase 2: Core Features
- User profile management integration
- Job data integration
- Job application system
- Basic error handling

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Payment and subscription integration
- Job matching and recommendations
- Admin dashboard integration
- Email notifications

### Phase 4: Polish and Optimization
- Comprehensive error handling
- Loading states and UX improvements
- Performance optimization
- Testing and validation

## Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- Next.js 14+
- React 18+
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Existing UI components

### Backend Dependencies
- Node.js API server running on localhost:3000
- MongoDB database
- Razorpay payment gateway
- Email service (SMTP)

### External Services
- Razorpay for payments
- SMTP service for emails
- File storage for resumes

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Changes**: Backend API might change during development
  - *Mitigation*: Use versioned APIs and maintain backward compatibility
- **Performance Issues**: Large datasets might cause slow loading
  - *Mitigation*: Implement pagination, caching, and lazy loading
- **Authentication Issues**: Token management complexity
  - *Mitigation*: Use proven JWT libraries and implement proper error handling

### Integration Risks
- **Data Mismatch**: Frontend and backend data structures might differ
  - *Mitigation*: Use TypeScript interfaces and data transformation utilities
- **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error responses
  - *Mitigation*: Implement standardized error handling and user feedback

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Foundation (Completed)
- **Phase 2**: Core Features (1-2 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: Advanced Features (1-2 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: Polish and Optimization (1 week)

## Success Metrics

- All backend endpoints successfully integrated
- Zero critical bugs in production
- User authentication working 100% of the time
- Payment processing success rate > 95%
- Page load times < 3 seconds
- User satisfaction with new features

## Conclusion

This integration project will transform the NotifyX frontend from a mock-data application to a fully functional job portal platform. The comprehensive backend API provides all necessary functionality, and the frontend is well-structured to integrate seamlessly. The phased approach ensures steady progress while maintaining code quality and user experience.
